* GentleWind (aka. GentleVim)

A Neovim configuration inspired by [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] and base on [[https://fennel-lang.org][Fennel]].

*Attention: this project is under heavy development and might break anything you see!*

* Basic Opinions
  1. Operation habits are valuable, for me most of them are nurtured from Spacemacs.
  2. Lisp(-like) languages are better configuration languages. :)
  3. Link as many external services as possible. (via dbus/rpc/nREPL, it depends)
  4. REPL loops and commands exist everywhere, just like air.

* Requirements
  - Neovim >= 0.5
  - [[https://github.com/Olical/aniseed][Olical/Anissed]]
  - [[https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim][wbthomason/packer.nvim]]
